                    <p>Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as hardware, software and data
                        from cyberthreats. The practice is used by individuals and enterprises to protect against
                        unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.</p>
                    <p>Cybersecurity can be divided into a few common categories.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether
                            targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised
                            application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security
                            begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in
                            transit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data
                            assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that
                            determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.
                        </li>
                        <li>End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone
                            can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good
                            security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in
                            unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons is vital for the security of
                            any organization.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="section-heading" style="color: var(--bs-warning);">The scale of the cyber threat</h2>
                    <p>The global cyber threat continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with a rising number of data
                        breaches each year. A report by RiskBased Security revealed that a shocking 7.9 billion records
                        have been exposed by data breaches in the first nine months of 2019 alone. This figure is more
                        than double (112%) the number of records exposed in the same period in 2018.</p>
                    <p>Medical services, retailers and public entities experienced the most breaches, with malicious
                        criminals responsible for most incidents. Some of these sectors are more appealing to
                        cybercriminals because they collect financial and medical data, but all businesses that use
                        networks can be targeted for customer data, corporate espionage, or customer attacks.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            <p class="mb-0" style="color: var(--bs-warning);">With the scale of the cyber threat set to
                                continue to rise, the International Data Corporation predicts that worldwide spending on
                                cyber-security solutions will reach a massive $133.7 billion by 2022. Governments across
                                the globe have responded to the rising cyber threat with guidance to help organizations
                                implement effective cyber-security practices.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>One of the most problematic elements of cybersecurity is the evolving nature of security risks.
                        As new technologies emerge, and as technology is used in new or different ways, new attack
                        avenues are developed. Keeping up with these frequent changes and advances in attacks, as well
                        as updating practices to protect against them, can be challenging. Issues include ensuring all
                        elements of cybersecurity are continually updated to protect against potential vulnerabilities.
                        This can be especially difficult for smaller organizations without the staff or in-house
                        resources.</p>

                        Cyber security professionals continually defend computer systems
                        against different types of cyber threats. Cyber attacks hit
                        businesses and private systems every day, and the variety of
                        attacks has increased quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The motives for cyber attacks are many. One is money. Cyber
                        attackers may take a system offline and demand payment to restore
                        its functionality. Ransomware, an attack that requires payment to
                        restore services, is now more sophisticated than ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Corporations are vulnerable to cyber attacks, but individuals are
                        targets too, often because they store personal information on
                        their mobile phones and use insecure public networks.

                    <p>
                        Malware is malicious software such as spyware, ransomware, viruses
                        and worms. Malware is activated when a user clicks on a malicious
                        link or attachment, which leads to installing dangerous software.
                    </p>
                    <p>Malware, once activated, can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Block access to key network components (ransomware)</li>
                        <li>Install additional harmful software</li>
                        <li>
                            Covertly obtain information by transmitting data from the hard
                            drive (spyware)
                        </li>
                        <li>Disrupt individual parts, making the system inoperable</li>

                        Denial of Service

                    <p>
                        A denial of service (DoS) is a type of cyber attack that floods a
                        computer or network so it can’t respond to requests. A distributed
                        DoS (DDoS) does the same thing, but the attack originates from a
                        computer network. Cyber attackers often use a flood attack to
                        disrupt the “handshake” process and carry out a DoS.

                        Phishing

                    <p>
                        Phishing attacks use fake communication, such as an email, to trick the receiver into opening it
                        and carrying out the instructions inside, such as providing a credit card number. The goal is
                        to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information or to install malware on the
                        victim’s machine.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        With the right password, a cyber attacker has access to a wealth of information. Social
                        engineering is a type of password attack that Data Insider defines as “a strategy cyber
                        attackers use that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves tricking people into
                        breaking standard security practices.” Other types of password attacks include accessing a
                        password database or outright guessing.
